The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is based on the
intelligent foraging behaviour of honey bee swarm, and was first proposed
by Karaboga in 2005.

"""
This package contains all the available bee types in the system. Each type of bee is meant for solving different kind of
optimization problems, for example, continuous unconstrained problems. New types of bees can be added here creating a 
new class that implements the BeeProtype interface. This interface follows the Prototype design pattern 
(https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/prototype) and is used by the Hive to run the algorithm.
